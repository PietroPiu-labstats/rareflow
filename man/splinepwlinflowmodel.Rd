\title{Piecewise-Linear Spline Flow (Monotone)}
\usage{
splinepwlinflowmodel(d = 2, K = 8, theta = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{Dimension of the latent space.}

\item{K}{Number of spline bins.}

\item{theta}{Optional parameter vector. If NULL, random initialization.}
}
\value{
A flow model object with methods:
\itemize{
\item sampleq(n)
\item logq(z0)
\item applyflow(z0)
}
}
\description{
A readable implementation of a monotone piecewise-linear spline flow.
Each dimension is transformed independently using:
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item K bins with learned widths (w) and heights (h)
\item softmax ensures positivity and normalization
\item the transformation is applied in sigmoid space for stability
}

The flow is invertible and differentiable almost everywhere.
